When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository will be usefull when the project i am working on is a multi-programmer project,
where each one has a part he is responsible of. thus, each person publishes the part he is responsible
for, and the director merges those parts as he see fit.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I would like manual control over pulls in case other contributers made suggestions not according to what i had in mind.
